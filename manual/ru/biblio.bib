  abstract = {pyGrav is a Python-based open-source software dedicated to the complete processing of relative-gravity data. It is particularly suited for time-lapse gravity surveys where high precision is sought. Its purpose is to bind together single-task processing codes in a user-friendly interface for handy and fast treatment of raw gravity data from many stations of a network. The intuitive object-based implementation allows to easily integrate additional functions (reading/writing routines, processing schemes, data plots) related to the appropriate object (a station, a loop, or a survey). This makes pyGrav an evolving tool. Raw data can be corrected for tides and air pressure effects. The data selection step features a double table-plot graphical window with either manual or automatic selection according to specific thresholds on data channels (tilts, gravity values, gravity standard deviation, duration of measurements, etc.). Instrumental drifts and gravity residuals are obtained by least square analysis of the dataset. This first step leads to the gravity simple differences between a reference point and any point of the network. When different repetitions of the network are done, the software computes then the gravity double differences and associated errors. The program has been tested on two specific case studies: a large dataset acquired for the study of water storage changes on a small catchment in West Africa, and a dataset operated and processed by several different users for geothermal studies in northern Alsace, France. In both cases, pyGrav proved to be an efficient and easy-to-use solution for the effective processing of relative-gravity data.},

The new technique was developed between March 1999 and September 2000 in a pilot study conducted in the southern Salt Lake Valley along an east-west profile of eight stations from the Wasatch Mountains to the Jordan River. Gravity changes at eight profile stations were referenced to a set of five stations in the northern Salt Lake Valley, which showed residual signals of [Formula: see text] in amplitude, assuming a reference station near the Great Salt Lake to be stable. Referenced changes showed maximum amplitudes of [Formula: see text] through [Formula: see text] at profile stations, with minima in summer 1999, maxima in winter 1999–2000, and some decrease through summer 2000. Gravity signals were likely a composite of production-induced changes monitored by well-water levels, elevation changes, precipitation-induced vadose-zone changes, and local irrigation effects for which magnitudes were estimated quantitatively.},

  abstract  = {The purpose of the study was to develop a method to determine the
  coefficient of storage of a water-table aquifer by correlating change in
  gravitational field intensity with change in groundwater storage. In theory,
  this purpose may be accomplished by modifying the Bouguer slab equation to
  coefficient of storage equals 78.3 times the ratio of change in gravity in
  milligals to change in water-table elevation in feet. Errors which result from
  the Bouguer slab assumptions may be corrected through analysis of tilted
  finite slabs. Field investigations were made to test the theory. The study
  area is located in the northern Tucson basin, Pima County, Arizona, and lies
  on unconfined basin-fill deposits and flood-plain alluvium aquifers. The
  basin-fill aquifer overlies less permeable Rillito beds and is overlain by the
  flood-plain alluvium. The two upper aquifers are flat-bedded heterogeneous
  deposits of sand and gravel. The water table through these aquifers slopes
  westward at a rate of approximately 0.5 degree. Estimates of the coefficient
  of storage for the basin-fill deposits and the flood-plain alluvium have been
  previously made by others from laboratory and field tests and by model
  analyses. The most reliable determinations of the coefficient of storage range
  from 0.15. to 0.30. The significance of the gravity method lies in
  determination of the coefficient of storage by measuring the quantities which
  define it: rise or decline in head and weight of water placed into or removed
  from storage. Change in gravity was determined by repeated gravity surveys
  using the same set of field stations through the period, October 1968 to June
  1970. Water levels in wells were recorded for the same period. The
  relationship between change in gravitational field intensity and change in
  head was determined using a straight line solution method, and the coefficient
  of storage was computed from the slope of the straight line. At the conclusion
  of the field investigations, coefficients of storage were computed for 17
  field stations. After correction for limited area of water-level decline and
  for water-table slope, the values of the coefficients ranged from 0.11 to
  0.41. An error analysis indicates a maximum probable error in gravity data of
  ± 26 microgals. This error may be reduced by modifying the survey and
  reduction procedures and by using a more sensitive gravimeter. Analysis of
  changes in gravitational field intensity resulting from change of amounts of
  water in the unsaturated zone indicates that the coefficient of storage
  computed for field stations near Rillito Creek, the source of the
  unsaturated-zone water, are too low. Using data from stations least affected
  by gravity increases after stream recharge, a probable range of 0.25 to 0.29
  was determined for the coefficient of storage in the study area. The range for
  values of the coefficient of storage using the gravity method confirms the
  larger coefficient of storage estimation made by others for the same area. The
  study indicates that the gravity method may be used with success over aquifers
  which have high coefficients of storage and in which the water table rises or
  declines 20 feet or more. However, large changes in the water content of the
  unsaturated zone cause gravity data to show large scatter with respect to
  water-level data. For this reason the gravity method is more suitable for
  analysis of those portions of a water-table aquifer which are recharged by
  underflow than for the portions recharged by infiltration from surface
  sources.},

              Newlyn, England, are analysed without astronomical prejudice as to what
              frequencies are present, and what are not, thus allowing for background
              noise. The method consists of generating various complex input functions
              $c_i$, $(t)$ for the same time interval as the recorded tide $\pounds(t)$, and of
              determining the associated lag weights $w$ in the convolutions

              bilinear processes; the Fourier transforms of $w$ for any chosen $i$ (or $ij$ )
              are the linear (or bilinear) admittances. Input functions are the (time
              variable) spherical harmonics of the gravitational potential and of radiant

              by hour, directly from the Kepler-Newton laws and the known orbital
              constants of Moon and Sun, without time-harmonic expansions (unlike the
              harmonic method of Kelvin-Darwin-Doodson). The radiative input is required
              to predict non-gravitational tides, and it allows for the essential
              distinction that the Earth is opaque to radiation and transparent to
              gravitation.},
